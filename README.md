## development setup
- clone the repository or open it in a github codespace
- if downloaded locally (not codespaces):
    -   install the [remote development pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
    - vscode will prompt you to open the development container (you may need to restart vscode)
